# BPQ32-Stuff
This is a collection of scripts and info used for BPQ32

These are used from some Linux server which has remote access (usually through BPQ Telnet) to 
connect to your BPQ32 Node. This will Telnet to the node, then issue a connect to a remote node via RF.
This is intended to validate the  RF radio itself, more than it is the path. But, but nature, is doing both.
